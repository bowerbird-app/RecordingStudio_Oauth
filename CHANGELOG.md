## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-02

First release of the Recording Studio authorization server.

### Added
- `OauthClient` registry (name, client id, redirect URIs, public or confidential, named API, revoked)
- `OauthAuthorization` as an Accessible actor, with authorization codes, rotating refresh tokens, and delegated access tokens
- Two-screen Connect: list of workspaces and folders, then permission capped at the person's own access
- Connected apps
- Staff admin of registered apps (Accessible grants on an admin root, not nominated admins)
- RFC 8414 discovery that points `token_endpoint` at Recording Studio API
- Registers `authorization_code` and `refresh_token` on Recording Studio API 0.5.2 via `RecordingStudioApi.register_oauth_grant`
- Dummy host with Seed Demo App
- Dummy Tailwind writes resolved gem `@source` paths so Flatpack classes emit on Cloud Agent install paths
- Connect, permission, and error sit in a viewport-centered `max-w-sm` frame like login. Connected apps and staff admin stay on default layout.
- Connect title is `{app} wants to connect to {site}` from OauthClient plus Site Settings `name_for`
- Connect list has no PageNav. Trailing status is a Flatpack Button (Connect/Reconnect primary, Connected secondary). Permission title is `{picked parent} permissions`. Primary action is Connect.

### Notes
- This gem is not Users, Doorkeeper, DCR, OIDC, SAML, or OAuth scopes
- Machine API keys stay in Recording Studio API
- Recording Studio API `~> 0.5.2` is required for the grant hook
- Flatpack `~> 0.1.144` so Site Settings `v0.1.0` can install
- Site Settings `~> 0.1` / dummy tag `v0.1.0`. Dummy also pins Attachable `v0.5.1` because that gem requires it.
